To run:

First, run the back-end:

- Run the main 'Udl4csResourcesApplication' within the 'udl4cs_resources' project directory

Next, run the Next.js front-end:

- Within the directory 'udl4cs_frontend/frontend', type 'npm run dev'
- Go to http://localhost:3000 on your browser

On the home page, you should see three resources which are made from data created in the Springboot backend, and fetched using Axios in the Next.js REACT framework.
