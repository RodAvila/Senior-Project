To run:

First, run the back-end:

- Run the main 'Udl4csResourcesApplication' within the 'udl4cs_resources' project directory

Next, run the Next.js front-end:

- Within the directory 'udl4cs_frontend/frontend', type 'npm run dev'
- Go to http://localhost:3000 on your browser

On the http://localhost:3000/resources tab, you should see resources created from the back-end displayed in a table.
Using the form on this tab, you can input more resources to see how they are added to the back-end and updated live on the front-end.
