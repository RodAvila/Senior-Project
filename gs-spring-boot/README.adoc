First step, make sure node.js is installed to 20.11.0 LTS (https://nodejs.org/en)

if npm isn't installed, install with 'npm install'

Check versions of node js and npm

'node -v'
 - should be v20.11.0

'npm -v'
 - should be 10.4.0

After these are installed and updated, navigate to the /complete/src/main/frontend folder

Next, there is an issue with the 'eslint' Linter in the program, so run 'npm install eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y'

Run 'npm start'

A separate browser window should appear with the REACT logo.
You can edit the /frontend/src/App.js file to change the frontend and it updates live to the site whenever you save

!! LINTER ISSUE:

There is a plugin called eslint that has consistent issues when trying to build this program, so I removed the following code from /complete/src/main/frontend/package.json to allow it to build. Otherwise, the code can be inserted as follows:

Insert below "scripts"{}

  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "react-app",
      "react-app/jest"
    ]
  },
